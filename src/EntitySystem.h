/*************************************************************************************************************
//gameObjects contain only the data that is to be manipulated, no functions except their constructors.
//each gameObject and component is stored contigeously in memory inside  the respective vector in EntityProcessing.h
//This gives each gameObject and component a very small memory footprint and also conforms to how
//the computer wants to consume the information. By avoiding the use of classes and the "new" keyword
//we do not need to worry about large objects spawning in (possibly)non-related areas of memory
//causing large memory footprints and many CPU cache misses
//
//Whereas before, to manipulate an object, we had to access the methods within its class and potentially
//deal messy inheritance chains that could have performance implications depending on their size
//we now have the single functions and processing functions to act upon, which we access directly.
//This implies that multi-threading is easier for data, as we can chain tasks and thread them in the appropriate
//order without the huge amount of issies trying to multi-thread normal objects
*************************************************************************************************************/

/*************************************************************************************************************
//The entity systems works similiar to a database, with relational IDs that bind each element together
//We have foreign keys in each component that link them to their respective game object
//when we process the data inside the game object, we look at the IDs, then update that corresponding data
//that we have added
*************************************************************************************************************/

//A component may only contain raw data and mutators and getters relating to that data. All methods relating to
//update are done in EntityProcesing in batch
